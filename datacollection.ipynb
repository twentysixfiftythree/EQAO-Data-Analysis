    "# EQAO Grade 9 Math Results Analysis\n",
    "## EQAO Info\n",
    "EQAO is a yearly-run census-like test for Grades 3, 6 and 9 run by the Government of Ontario. The results of the students' scores are said to contribute to the growth of Ontario's curriculums.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "Unfortunately, the newest results, which are of most interest, are only made publicly available through a query on the EQAO website. I'd imagine that posting a spreadsheet with each of the school's results would be easier than an interactive website.\n",
    "The EQAO website is indexed using (\"https://www.eqao.com/report/?id=####\"). Iterating through each page that has the required data will be the method of data collection. \n",
    "### Features\n",
    "The following features of each page will be scraped:\n",
    "- The average achievement of each school\n",
    "- Total school enrolment\n",
    "- Number of students taking the test.\n",
    "- Town name (to cross reference)\n",
    "There are socio-economic factors that will be included that are not found on the indexing of the EQAO page. These will be scraped via another CSV file:\n",
    "- School's town's population\n",
    "- Poverty rate in the respective school's town\n"
